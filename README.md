## Fake news Detection:
The proliferation of fake news in recent times has led to more focused research in computational tools able to identify reliable and trustworthy news. In this project we analyse and implement machine learning models for automatic fake news detection. Data consists of short statements of news releases, interviews, campaign speeches, Facebook posts and tweets made during the 2016 U.S presidential campaign from Politifact.com.. We use various pre-processing, vectorisation, parameter tuning methods across a range of classifiers to identufy fake news.


### Dataset: 
Data that we use for this project is the 'LIAR' dataset, a public available fake news detection corpus. I have uploaded a zip file with the data. Download it to the folder having the 'fake_news_detection.ipynb' jupyter notebook. It contains 3 TSV files namely train.tsv, test.tsv and valid.csv.
The data can also be downloaded online from [LIAR Dataset](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip)

## how to run
1) run 1vs all svm file directly on folder
2) run 3lable merge code file directly on folder
3) i)open code folder
  ii)run Fake_news_detection file for other ML models
